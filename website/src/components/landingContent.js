          question: "What is ZAKI?",
          answer:
            "ZAKI is your day-to-day AI — one that actually remembers you. It chats, takes on whole tasks through Agent, keeps each project clean in its own Space, and holds everything you've told it in a memory you can see, correct, and control. The point: you never start from zero.",
        },
        {
          question: "What is the difference between ZAKI and Spaces?",
          answer:
            "ZAKI is for continuity, memory, and recall across time. Spaces are for structured execution inside a dedicated workspace. ZAKI helps you keep the long thread. Spaces help you do the focused work cleanly.",
        },
        {
          question: "What are Spaces?",
          answer:
            "Spaces are structured AI workspaces where each project can hold its own instructions, documents, and threads. They keep your work organized and your context clean.",
        },
        {
          question: "Why are there both ZAKI and Spaces?",
          answer:
            "Because continuity and execution are different jobs. ZAKI handles the long-thread relationship and memory layer. Spaces handle dedicated task execution, drafting, research, and organized project work.",
        },
        {
          question: "When should I use ZAKI instead of Spaces?",
          answer:
            "Use ZAKI when you want continuity, planning, memory, and an ongoing thread that carries across time. Use Spaces when the work needs its own instructions, documents, and shared project context.",
        },
        {
          question: "Is ZAKI Agent live?",
          answer:
            "Yes. Agent is part of V1 with account memory, visible phases, and follow-through. Some tools and future product lanes remain gated until their contracts are complete.",
        },
        {
          question: "Why are some ZAKI surfaces gated?",
          answer:
            "Because ZAKI only exposes a surface when product state, entitlement, memory, UI, and tests agree. Live products should be usable; future lanes should be clearly marked.",
        },
        {
          question: "How does free Chat access work?",
          answer:
            "Chat starts free with weekly capacity. Sign in when you want account continuity, Brain memory, and Agent follow-through.",
        },
        {
          question: "Is Chat free?",
          answer:
            "Yes. Chat starts free and limited. Agent adds account continuity when the work should persist.",
        },
        {
          question: "Does ZAKI claim to outperform ChatGPT or Claude?",
          answer:
            "No. Spaces do not claim to beat the latest GPT or Claude models on raw capability. The case for ZAKI is product shape: organization, pricing, control, workspace structure, and the operator direction. It also works across languages natively.",
        },
        {
          question: "What does powered by ZAKI's private runtime mean?",
          answer:
            "ZAKI's private runtime provides the memory continuity, process visibility, trainability, and agentic discipline that let ZAKI behave more like a persistent digital counterpart than an ordinary chat session.",
        },
        {
          question: "When will broader access open?",
          answer:
            "Broader access opens only after product, entitlement, backend, UI, and E2E readiness agree.",
        },
        {
          question: "Why should I care about Agent now?",
          answer: "Because the public app should promise only what is wired. Users can start with Chat and use Agent for continuity while future lanes mature.",
